Please find a PDF copy of the poster presented at AGU 2021 (josef-garen-licor-poster-agu-2021.pdf).

We also provide a script for correcting LI-6400XT data based on the corrections developed in this work (scripts/correct_licor6400.R). An example analysis which reads in a raw LI-6400XT data file and corrects it is also provided (scripts/example_analysis.R).
